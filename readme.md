model database. 
The various pieces of the model have been grouped into components;

Open To-Do's
------------
- The top radius of the tower section is not correct, it needs to be narrowed.
The correct dimensions for the tower are 16' radius at the base,
7.5' radius at the top, and 149' tall. 
- The spiral needs to be redone, it's actually two spirals, not one.
- Check whether the visibility radius of the lighthouse is actually correct.
