The Model
---------
This model was built in Sketchup 8 and contributed to the FlightGear 
model database. 

Open To-Do's
------------
- The top radius of the tower section is not correct, it needs to be narrowed.
- The spiral needs to be redone, it's actually two spirals, not one.
- Check whether the visibility radius of the lighthouse is actually correct.
